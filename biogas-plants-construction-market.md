<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plants Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas plants can be categorized into two main types based on digestion processes: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion involves the use of high-moisture feedstocks, typically producing biogas in large, anaerobic digesters. This method is efficient for organic waste, such as wastewater and food scraps. In contrast, dry digestion handles low-moisture feedstocks, requiring less water and often using solid organic materials, like agricultural residues. Both methods serve to convert organic waste into valuable biogas for renewable energy.</p></p>
