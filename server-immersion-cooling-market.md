<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Immersion Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-phase</li><li>Two-phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The server immersion cooling market is categorized into two main types: single-phase and two-phase cooling. Single-phase cooling involves submerging servers in a dielectric fluid that remains liquid during the cooling process, effectively dissipating heat. In contrast, two-phase cooling allows the fluid to vaporize, absorbing more heat and increasing efficiency. Both methods enhance thermal management in data centers, reduce energy consumption, and improve overall performance, making them popular solutions for managing heat in high-density server environments.</p></p>
