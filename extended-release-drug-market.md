<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extended Release Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sustained Release Drug</li><li>Controlled Release Drug</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The extended release drug market includes two main types: sustained release and controlled release drugs. Sustained release drugs are designed to release their active ingredient gradually over an extended period, maintaining therapeutic effects while minimizing peaks and troughs in drug levels. Controlled release drugs, on the other hand, manage the release rate more precisely, allowing for predictable pharmacokinetics and improved patient adherence. Both types aim to enhance efficacy, reduce side effects, and improve overall treatment outcomes by optimizing drug delivery.</p></p>
