<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enzyme Replacement Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injectable Agents</li><li>Oral Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The enzyme replacement therapy market is primarily categorized into two types: injectable agents and oral agents. Injectable agents are typically proteins administered via subcutaneous or intravenous routes, offering rapid absorption and immediate therapeutic effects, often used for conditions like lysosomal storage disorders. In contrast, oral agents are taken by mouth, providing a convenient alternative for patients; however, these may face challenges with absorption and efficacy. Both types aim to supplement deficient enzymes, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Enzyme Replacement Therapy Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gaucher Disease</li><li>Fabry Disease</li><li>MPS Disease</li><li>Gastrointestinal Disease</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is employed to treat various inherited metabolic disorders, including Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and MPS (Mucopolysaccharidoses) disease. In Gaucher disease, ERT alleviates symptoms by augmenting glucocerebrosidase levels. For Fabry disease, it targets alpha-galactosidase A deficiency, improving life quality. MPS diseases benefit from ERT by providing necessary enzymes to degrade glycosaminoglycans. Additionally, gastrointestinal diseases can be supported through ERT by enhancing enzyme activity for better digestion, with ongoing research discovering potential applications in other conditions.</p></p>
